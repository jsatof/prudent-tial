# prudent-tial
Inspired by games like Fire Emblem, Disgaea, and the like. It's a tile-based game where you control a party of characters, fight your way across a path to get your units to an escape tile.
This game will serve as a sandbox for experimenting with different AI techniques. For something like this, it will most likely involve decision trees.

# Design
Here is a screenshot of the main level. All that's currently implemented is spawning the character, and moving the cursor.

Here is a mock of what I plan on having in the game as features. This kind of menu should show up when you click on a unit.
